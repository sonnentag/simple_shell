.SH NAME
simple_shell - UNIX command language interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands directly from the standard input or from a file.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
simple_shell first reads a line of input from an user. The line inputted is read and split into tokens. The simple_shell then reads each token. If a builtin is seen, then it is executed. If not, then it reads each token and goes through the PATH to check for any executables present. A new process is forked and executes the code. The output is printed, then it sends the wait signal, and finally the parent process terminates.

.SH MODES
